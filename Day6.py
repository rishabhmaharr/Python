# Q: You need to take user input and based on those inputs, create the best investment advisor for the user. Take inputs such as name, age, income, etc. And suggest investment options based on tailored inputs. For example: If a person is 75 years old, he should plan more in Debt MF rather than Equity MF. Use best practices.
